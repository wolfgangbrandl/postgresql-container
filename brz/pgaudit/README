The PostgreSQL Audit Extension (or pgaudit) provides detailed session and/or object
audit logging via the standard logging facility provided by PostgreSQL.

Bind-mount this directory under /opt/app-root/src in the container, and all the
*.conf files from postgresql-cfg/ files will be included to postgresql.conf.

This config file enables the pgaudit extensions that is available in the container
image, but needs to be enabled.
